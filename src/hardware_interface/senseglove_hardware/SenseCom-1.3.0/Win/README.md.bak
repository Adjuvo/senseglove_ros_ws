# SenseCom for Windows
You can either run the executable contained within the SenseCom_Win_vX folder, or make a proper installation on your PC using the installer in this directory.

SenseCom requires a Microsoft Visual C++ package to run, which comes with the installer. If you've set your PC up for C++ development, you might already have this package installed.
Note that without using the installer, you will need to manually install a Visual C++ package to be able to use SenseCom.  You can find a installer in this folder, or download it from Microsoft via https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe.
