# SenseCom for Android

A SenseCom version for Android devices. This includes Standalone VR Headsets like the Oculus Quest Vive Focus and Pico Neo.

Unlike the desktop version, SenseCom is not required to interface with your Haptic Gloves on Android. Communication will instead be handled within the simulation itself.
However, SenseCom can be a useful debugging and testing tool for your VR devices if you suspect you're having connectivity issues.

## Installation

The SenseCom software is not currently available in the app store, so it must be side-loaded onto your Android Device using the Android Debug Bridge.
If you're using an Oculus Quest 2, you can do so via the [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/) program. 
For other devices, we recommend searching for "sideload" followed by your device name.
